# CSS to the Rescue @cmda-minor-web 19-20
In this three week course you are going to create an innovative, experimantal, yet pleasurable user experience by using CSS and SVG. No Javascrpt allowed.

## Concept
My concept is around a poem. It's called “A Psalm of Life”, by Henry Wadsworth. It's a very old poem, but still beautiful. I want to achieve a storytelling website, where the visuals support and enhance the poem. Every key element in a paragraph is visualised with CSS. I'm only making use of black and white. So no other colors. Within my project I'm only using CSS selectors. So no classes, no ID's

## Install
1. Open the terminal on your computer.
2. Create a directory in a location of your choice with `mkdir` in your console.
3. Clone the repository with the following command:
<br></br>
`https://github.com/Coenmathijssen/css-to-the-rescue-1920.git`
<br></br>
4. Navigate to the repo with the `cd` command in your console. Next, install all the dependencies with 
<br></br>
`npm install`
<br></br>
5. For building, bundling and compiling of the SCSS and JS, use
<br></br>
`npm run build`
<br></br>
6. To develop and see changes live, use:
<br></br>
`npm run dev`
These command are editable in the package.json file
<br></br>
6. Open the localhost to view the webapp.
